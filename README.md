# StreetPhyter
An open source HTML5 Fighting game built with the Phaser engine!

Latest build can be played here: https://moe-khan123.github.io/

How often do we see a good fighting game for the browser? My intention is to create a good, functionable fighting game engine!

Initially using Street Fighter 2 and Street Fighter Alpha 3 sprites, I plan to incorporate concepts from several fighting games into this game.

Controls: 
-Arrow keys to walk and crouch. 
-Q to Light punch
-W to Medium punch

What's done so far:
- Ability to walk forward, backward, crouch.
- Simple Enemy AI has been coded, but commented out for the time being. 
- Special Moves Input Detection has been made (Shoryuken Motion, Hadouken Motion), although the actual move has not been programmed yet. 
- Damage and health has been programmed in.

To Do in the near term:
- Update Ken's sprites to include all his moves. Including neutral jump, back and forwards jump, hadouken, tatsu and shoryuken.
- Ability to neutral jump, jump forward and backward.
- Special Moves implementation
- a complex hitbox/hurtbox
- Blockstun 


If you want to use your own sprites for this game, feel free to contribute and I'll be glad to put you in the credits section!
