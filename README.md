An open source HTML5 Fighting game built with the Phaser engine!

How often do we see a good fighting game for the browser? My intention is to create a good, functionable fighting game engine!

June 8th 2017: So far, ability to walk backwards, forwards, crouch, crouch block, standing light punch and standing medium punch is working. 
Collission detection functionable between opponent and Character
Simple AI has been built (walk towards player and punch)
Health and damage has been coded in, just need to put in the user interface of the health bars.

TODO in the upcoming commits: 
- Add in Ken's sprites for hard punch and the kick buttons
- Implement functionality of the kick buttons
- Block stun when punch is landed, and recovery frames when a punch or kick has been made.
- V-Trigger meter and Critical Art meter similar to Street Fighter 5
- A more smarter AI system
