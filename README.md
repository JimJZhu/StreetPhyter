# StreetPhyter
An open source HTML5 Fighting game built with the Phaser engine!

How often do we see a good fighting game for the browser? My intention is to create a good, functionable fighting game engine!

Initially using Street Fighter 2 and Street Fighter Alpha 3 sprites, I plan to incorporate concepts from several fighting games into this game.

If the Phaser engine allows to, I plan to do the following:
-> Critical Art/Super meter found in Street Fighter/KOF/etc..
-> Concept of a Roman Cancel similar to that of Guilty Gear
-> Concept of a breaker similar to that of Guilty Gear/Skullgirls
-> Tag mechanics like Capcom's versus series/Skullgirls/Tekken Tag Tournament

If you want to use your own sprites for this game, feel free to contribute and I'll be glad to put you in the credits section!
