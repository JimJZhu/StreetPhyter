An open source HTML5 Fighting game built with the Phaser engine!

As a fighting game enthusiast and a developer by profession, I decided to tackle this as a side project. There are not many open source fighting games out there, so I figured it would be neat if I start one. I plan to add more features day by day.

Controls: 
Arrow keys to move.
Q: Light Punch
W: Medium Punch
E: Hard Punch (TODO)

A: Light Kick (TODO)
S: Medium Kick (TODO)
D: Hard Kick (TODO)


June 6th, 2017: Initial commit.
-> Spritesheet for Ken. Still incomplete
-> Able to walk forward, backward, crouch.
-> Standing light punch and standing medium punch functional.

-> TODO for next few commits: 
SLP and SMP is very jittery... 
Also perhaps a finite state machine library to incorporate into to get rid of this tedious if statements when handling inputs. 
Neutral jump, forward jump, backward jump, standing hard punch and all the kick buttons. 



Credits to Capcom for the inspiration and the sprites.
